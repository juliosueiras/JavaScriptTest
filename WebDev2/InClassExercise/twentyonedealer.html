Week 2: In-class exercise
Justin Alerta

This program simulates drawing the dealer's hand in a game of 21.
Implement the program by adding JavaScript which:
1) Creates a variable that holds the dealer's total
2) Repeatedly do the following until the dealer's total is at least 17:
    a) "Draw a card" - generate a random number between 1 and 10
    b) Add the card value to the total
    c) Display the dealer's total in an alert dialog
3) Display text by changing the innerHTML property of the <h1> element. The text should be center-aligned.
    a) If the dealer's total is greater than 21, display "Dealer busts!" in red
    b) Otherwise, display "Dealer has XX" in green (where XX is the total)
